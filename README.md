# Google Books Search API - by Jwellstx

## Description

### A simple application that utilizes `Node`, `Express` and `React` as well as the `GoogleBooks API` to create a react app that allows you to query for your favorite books.  In addition you are able to push your more desired book to a saved list and view your saved book at a later point.  When you are you finished, you can then remove them for the saved list!

## Starting the app locally

First clone the app then run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```
Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
